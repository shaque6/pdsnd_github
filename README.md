Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project is to explore the US Bikeshare data provided.
The program will ask the user which city they would like to view the data and then if they would like to filter by month and day.
Once this is input, the user will be shown different metrics based off the bikeshare data.
At the end, they will also be asked if they would like to view the raw data.
